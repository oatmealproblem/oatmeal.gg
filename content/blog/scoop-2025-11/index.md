I'm overdue for an update here! Life has been busy with events both expected and unexpected, but I've managed some progress since August's post.

## Paint a galaxy

Paint a Galaxy now lets you place custom wormholes. You can use it to create map with regions connected only by wormhole. Combined with spawn customization, you could make a star clusters that aren't unexplorable early game, so there's a mid-game colonization rush. Other than that, I fixed lots of bugs. It's a bit boring, but I did manage to fix every known fixable issue!

This will continue to be my main project for the short-term. Now that the mod part is in a good place, I'm going to improve the UI and editing tools, while also exploring some technology I'll potentially incorporate into StellarMaps.

# Other Development

Since Augist, I've made a few small updates to this site. I also contributed a fix for [Shiki's Colorized Brackets plugin](https://shiki.style/packages/colorized-brackets). I wrote that plugin, so I try to keep an eye out for issues to help maintain it.

## Support Me

A few folks have asked in the past, so I've finally set up some methods to support me monetarily:

- [GitHub Sponsorships](https://github.com/sponsors/oatmealproblem)
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/oatmealproblem)
- [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/oatmealproblem)

Things are pretty bare-bones there, so I'll work on filling out those pages some more.

Don't worry, all my work will remain free and open source. I have no short-term plans to attach any rewards to donations (though I might later add Discord roles, credits, etc). For now, you will just receive my heart-felt gratitude ❤️
