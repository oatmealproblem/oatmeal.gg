Alpha 3 is released and it's a big one! Almost everything has been expanded or reworked. Here's some highlights:

- **Enemy Variety**: three new enemies each with new mechanics and challenges
- **Map Variety**: 5 new map types, from open plains, to rugged badlands
- **New Buildings**: the player gets new toys too! Roads, absorbers, shield generators, and more!
- **Overhauled Economy**: the economy has been rebalanced and many buildings reworked. Farms take a full day to produce food, so make sure you defend them overnight!
- **Music and Sound Effects**: the world isn't so quiet anymore

And loads of other changes big and small. A year in the making, this update really fleshes out the game.
