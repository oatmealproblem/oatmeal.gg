# Alpha 1: They Come at Night

You can now play the first alpha release over on <a href="https://mscottmoore.itch.io/reflector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a>!

Here's what it all includes:

- Defend your colony from the waves of drones that attack at night
- Make the most of every shot by manipulating lasers with splitters and projectors
- Mine metal so you can expand your colony
- Build residences to control where your population lives
- Build walls to buy yourself a few turns before the enemies break through
- Build projectors to expand the area where you can place reflectors
- Build mines so you don't need to mine by hand
- Randomly generated maps with mountains and lakes to keep things interesting game to game

# Up Next

I'm going to take some time to focus on code refactoring and addressing any bugs or balance issues that come up. After a bit of that, I'll start working on the next release which will be focused on expanding the economy beyond just metal and giving your colonists some things to do.
