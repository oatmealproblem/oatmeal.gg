This blog was originally my dev log for <a target="_blank" href="https://oatmealproblem.itch.io/reflector">Reflector: Laser Defense</a>. I stopped working on that project, but I kept working on other things!

So, what have I been up to the last 2 and half years?

- <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/OatmealProblem/myworkshopfiles/?appid=281990">wrote several popular mods for Stellaris</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oatmealproblem/stellarmaps">made an app to draw stylized maps from Stellaris saves</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eliasdoehne/stellaris-dashboard">started contributing to and then maintaining the Stellaris Dashboard</a>
- changed jobs a few times
- started and abandoned other smaller projects

I guess mostly Stellaris!

This blog will no longer be about only Reflector. I'll post about whatever I'm working on. In the near-term, probably more Stellaris.
