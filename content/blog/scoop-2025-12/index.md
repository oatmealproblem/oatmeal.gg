## Paint a galaxy

This month, I contributed [a Steps component for Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/svelte/framework-components/steps) (a UI component library). At a glance, that's not anything to do with Paint a Galaxy. In fact, Paint a Galaxy doesn't even use Skeleton, it uses the more minimalist [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com) instead. However, it's starting outgrow Pico CSS's limited feature set. This next month, I'll be converting it over to Skeleton and redesigning the UI to better accomodate more painting tools and customization features (and using that "steps" component among others).

Well, how about those features I'll be implementing? In no particular order:

- zooming and panning the paint canvas
- symmetry, circle, and spiral tools
- guides (eg core, L-cluster)
- projects (save and work on multiple maps)
- customize unique system locations

After that, I expect Paint a Galaxy to go mostly dormant as I return focus to StellarMaps.

# Stellaris Mods

Stellaris released v4.2, and with a Stellaris update comes mod updates. I try my best to design my mods to be low-maintenance and that worked out well this time, with all except one requiring no changes (and the the one needing only minor changes).
